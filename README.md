ABSTRACT
Cataloguing and tracking an item in warehouse remains a big challenge for many large businesses nowadays as locating an item in a warehouse without a proper system or process can be daunting like finding a needle in a haystack. The process is not only taking a lot of time to be done but also increase the safety risk for the workers to repeatedly climb up the stair to check items on the higher level of rack for stock-taking. The organizations have to invest a lot of money to recruit workers to make the process faster. CPS X Series Dragonfly: Automated Drone QR-Code Scanner for Warehouse Stock-Take was introduced to helps the warehouse businesses to be more efficient, cost-effective, and productive. It consists of three main components namely autonomous drone, live streaming video processing server and inventory management system. An autonomous drone solution for Parrot Anafi drone is developed with the use of Python programming language, QR-code technology, Internet of Things (IoT), and computer vision. The QR-code technology is implemented as the main subject that helping the drone to navigate around the racks in a warehouse autonomously. The methodology implemented in this project is Scrum which focus on teamâ€™s capability to develop the project rapidly and flexible in adapting the changing requirements. The system has been developed successfully by the end of this project.
